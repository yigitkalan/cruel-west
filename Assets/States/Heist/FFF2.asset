  storyText: 'I can''t kill a man who''s just trying to help me, fuck! I go outside,
    I can''t go inside now, I''m with other passengers. I gotta get lost I don''t
    have any other option, gotta get lost before they figure out how the hell that
    fire started... I sneak among passengers and dive into the woods, no one notice
    me in that chaos. I have nothing or no one left, maybe I should dissappear, vanish
    like I never existed...

    Yeah maybe I''ll do that...


    - you feel the
    wind blowing among the trees on your face, you feel relieved, even you don''t
    know why -
