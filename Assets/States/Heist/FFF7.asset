  storyText: 'Okay my bag is almost full, this much should be enough. I give a glance
    to Hector, and move to the wagon door. The horse Hector arranged is still near
    the train, I hop onto him and move away. Train is far away but I can still hear
    the shootings. Now loan money is ready, the dirty money. I can pay the debt to
    those piece of shits and get rid of all this mess and just dissappear...


    -
    you hope you can really dissappear, that hope is growing as you go away from
    the mess you left behind -


    1. Finish'
