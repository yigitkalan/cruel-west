  storyText: '... Okay, so train is my last option.

    I gotta rob the passenger
    train passing this town next week. Usually the rich people get on the train,
    or non rich peope who worked hard to get on it because it travels across the
    land.


    But is it a one man job or do I need a gang ? Doing something like
    this is way too hard, but if I can''t find some proper men I might have to do
    it that way

    2. Go alone and
    start preparing'
