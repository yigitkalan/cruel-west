  storyText: '...Here he comes, probably drunk since he drank till this time, he
    can barely walk. I approah him in the back and push my gun behind his head. Telling
    him to give me the ticket. He stops for a moment raising his both hands in fear,
    then he turns back and says " This... gun of yours... isn''t real, I''m not buyin''
    it" with a hickup. I am gonna have to deal with this now...



    1. Give him
    a taste of the "fake gun" of yours.

    2. Beat him up and force him to give
    you the ticket.'
