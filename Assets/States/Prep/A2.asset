  storyText: 'I can''t just rob the train by myself maybe I can start a fire for
    chaos but first gotta find a way to sneak in.Tickets are so expensive, I could
    steal a ticket but that might end bad, on the other finding another way to get
    in might be difficult. Maybe I can find a uniform, I remember hearing something
    about a train worker in the saloon.



    1. Steal a ticket

    2. Find a train
    worker uniform'
