  storyText: 'An old shack he lives in, I go in there... He can barely walk, first
    he was afraid then told him what I need. We start talking...


    Old man wants
    my gun, my gun! I can''t give my gun to him. He says he need it since he is a
    old man and needs protection from bandit crews like Hector''s.



    1. I can
    just SHOOT the old baggage, it''ll be best to stop his misery.

    2. Even it
    is a big risk I might not need my gun so it is not a bad deal'
