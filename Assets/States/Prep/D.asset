  storyText: "We have 2 options, either we're gonna surround the train while it's
    moving but we'll have little time, or we're gonna cut its way and organize a
    crash. Hector clearly states that he's with the crash idea with a threatening
    look. But I am gonna call the final decision.\r\n\r\n1. We're gonna go with the
    surrounding \r\n2. I think Hector knows more about these shit, we'll go his way"
