  storyText: 'As soon as I step in to the saloon I sense a dense scent of liqueur.
    Around the tables drunks sipping their drink, bar girls trying to get some tip
    from them. There... Hector leaning to the bar talking to a bar girl with his
    coat and oversized hat and his men lingering, they could be a good crew for the
    heist. But they have a bad reputation about killing. And I don''t know if I can
    trust Hector about this, I don''t know him very well.



    1. Try to convince
    them to join to the heist it''s not a one man job

    2. I can''t, Hector is
    not trustwhorty'
